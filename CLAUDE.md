This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the **Oddsy** repository.

## Project Overview

**Oddsy** is a Premier League football match prediction project that uses machine learning to predict Home/Draw/Away results. The project focuses on sophisticated feature engineering and data analysis of Premier League matches from 2019-2024.

## Project Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Build a machine learning model that predicts football match outcomes (H/D/A) better than naive baselines.

**Performance Targets:**
- **Minimum Acceptable:** > 43.6% accuracy (beat majority class baseline)
- **Good Model:** > 50% accuracy  
- **Excellent Model:** > 55% accuracy (industry-competitive)

**Key Baselines to Beat:**
- Random prediction (33/33/33): 33.3%
- Always predict Home: 43.6% 
- Weighted random by distribution: 35.4%

**Business Context:** Real Premier League distribution is naturally imbalanced (H: 43.6%, A: 33.4%, D: 23.0%) - this reflects actual football dynamics, not a data quality issue.

## Architecture & Data Pipeline

The project follows a clear data processing pipeline:

1. **Raw Data** (`data/raw/`) - Original Premier League CSV files
2. **Cleaned Data** (`data/cleaned/`) - Processed and cleaned datasets
3. **Processed Data** (`data/processed/`) - Feature-engineered datasets ready for ML
4. **Models** (`models/`) - Versioned trained models with metadata
5. **Evaluation** (`evaluation/`) - Performance reports & metrics history

## Data Integrity & Best Practices

### **Critical Data Principles:**
- **No Data Leakage:** All features calculated using ONLY historical data
- **Temporal Integrity:** Proper time-series cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit)
- **Feature Normalization:** All ML features normalized to 0-1 range
- **Target Encoding:** H→0, D→1, A→2
- **Leakage Detection:** 5-test validation suite (features, correlations, temporal, train/test gap, shift validation)

### **Elo Rating System:**
- **MVP Approach:** Initialize all teams equally, let system converge
- **K-Factor:** Constant K=32 for simplicity and reproducibility
- **Season Continuity:** Ratings carry over between seasons (critical!)

### **Feature Engineering Principles:**
1. **Quality over Quantity:** 5 traditional features > complex xG combinations
2. **Correlation Control:** Remove features with >0.9 correlation
3. **Temporal Safety:** Use shift(1) for rolling averages to prevent future information
4. **Data Leakage Vigilance:** Raw match results (xG, goals) are never features
5. **Validation First:** Test for leakage before celebrating high performance
