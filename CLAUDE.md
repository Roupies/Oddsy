This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Oddsy**, a Premier League football match prediction project that uses machine learning to predict Home/Draw/Away results. The project focuses on feature engineering and data analysis of Premier League matches from 2019-2024.

## Project Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Build a machine learning model that predicts football match outcomes (H/D/A) better than naive baselines.

**Performance Targets:**
- **Minimum Acceptable:** > 43.6% accuracy (beat majority class baseline)
- **Good Model:** > 50% accuracy  
- **Excellent Model:** > 55% accuracy (industry-competitive)

**Key Baselines to Beat:**
- Random prediction (33/33/33): 33.3%
- Always predict Home: 43.6% 
- Weighted random by distribution: 35.4%

**Business Context:** Real Premier League distribution is naturally imbalanced (H: 43.6%, A: 33.4%, D: 23.0%) - this reflects actual football dynamics, not a data quality issue.

## Core Architecture

### Data Pipeline Structure
The project follows a clear data processing pipeline:

1. **Raw Data** (`data/raw/`) - Original Premier League CSV files
2. **Cleaned Data** (`data/cleaned/`) - Processed and cleaned datasets
3. **Processed Data** (`data/processed/`) - Feature-engineered datasets ready for ML

### Key Components

**Main Feature Engineering Classes:**
- `OddsyFeatureEngineering` (feature_engineering.py) - Core feature engineering with Elo ratings, form scores, and H2H history
- `OddsyFixedFeatureEngineering` (fix_leakage_features.py) - Enhanced version with temporal features and data leakage fixes

**Analysis Scripts:**
- `final_data_analysis.py` - Comprehensive data analysis, correlation analysis, and ML readiness validation
- `scripts/exploration/` - Collection of data exploration and cleaning utilities

## Data Processing Flow

## Data Integrity & Professional Lessons Learned

**Critical Data Leakage Prevention:**
- All features are calculated using ONLY historical data (before current match)
- Rolling statistics use proper temporal windows
- League positions calculated from matches played before current date

**Elo Rating System - Professional Implementation:**
- **Critical Discovery:** Elo ratings must carry over between seasons (no reset)
- **Industry Standard:** Pre-load with historical ratings from previous season
- **MVP Approach:** Initialize all teams equally, then let system converge
- **Production Approach:** Use actual end-of-season ratings as starting points
- **K-Factor Strategy:** Constant K=32 for MVP, adaptive K for production

**Feature Validation Framework:**
- All ML features normalized to 0-1 range
- Correlation analysis ensures feature independence
- Manual validation on known matches for sanity checks
- Automated validation pipeline (`validate_features.py`) catches logic errors
- **Validation Types:** Data quality, feature logic, known match tests, distribution analysis

## Target Encoding

**Target Variable:** `FullTimeResult`
- `0` = Home win (H)
- `1` = Draw (D) 
- `2` = Away win (A)

**ML-Ready Dataset Format:**
- Final file: `premier_league_ml_ready.csv`
- Contains only: features (0-1 normalized) + encoded target
- No date/team columns in final ML dataset
- All features are numeric, no missing values

## Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- Accuracy (overall prediction accuracy)
- F1-macro (balanced performance across H/D/A)
- Confusion Matrix (detailed class performance)

**Validation Strategy:**
- Time Series Cross-Validation (respects chronological order)
- Train/Validation/Test split: 2019-2022 / 2022-23 / 2023-24
- Avoid data leakage in temporal splits

## Development History & Decision Log

### Phase 1: Initial Data Analysis (2024)
- **Decision:** Focus on Premier League 2019-2024 dataset
- **Rationale:** 5 years provides sufficient data while maintaining relevance
- **Alternative Rejected:** Extend to older seasons (data quality/relevance concerns)

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering Evolution

**2.1 Original Implementation (`feature_engineering.py`)**
- **Approach:** Elo ratings, form scores, H2H history
- **Bug Discovered:** Elo ratings reset each season (incorrect)
- **Impact:** Liverpool vs Norwich showed 0.500 (neutral) instead of Liverpool advantage

**2.2 Enhanced Implementation (`fix_leakage_features.py`)**
- **Improvements:** Added temporal features, rolling match stats, league positions
- **Critical Fix:** Eliminated data leakage in all rolling calculations
- **New Features:** `matchday_normalized`, `season_period_numeric`, possession proxies

**2.3 Elo Correction Analysis**
- **Problem Identified:** Elo should carry over between seasons (industry standard)
- **Options Evaluated:**
  - **Option A (CHOSEN):** MVP approach - all teams start equal, natural convergence
  - **Option B (REJECTED):** Pre-load with 2018-19 season-end ratings
  - **Option C (REJECTED):** Exclude early-season matches from training
- **Final Decision:** Option A for consistency - if we don't have complete historical data for Elo, we shouldn't pretend to have it for other features either

### Phase 3: Validation Framework Development

**3.1 Automated Validation (`validate_features.py`)**
- **Discovery:** Manual inspection missed logical errors that automated tests caught
- **Test Types:** Data quality, feature logic, known match validation, distribution analysis
- **Key Finding:** Liverpool vs Norwich test revealed Elo initialization problems

**3.2 Baseline Analysis (`calculate_baselines.py`)**
- **Critical Insight:** Real baseline is 43.6% (majority class), not 33.3% (random)
- **Performance Targets Established:**
  - Minimum: > 43.6%
  - Good: > 50%  
  - Excellent: > 55%

### Phase 4: Professional vs MVP Trade-offs

**4.1 K-Factor Strategy Decision**
- **Production Approach:** Adaptive K-factor (higher early season, lower later)
- **MVP Choice:** Constant K=32 for simplicity and interpretability
- **Rationale:** Early season volatility vs consistent methodology trade-off

**4.2 Class Imbalance Analysis**
- **Natural Distribution:** H: 43.6%, A: 33.4%, D: 23.0%
- **Decision:** Accept natural imbalance (reflects football reality)
- **Alternative Rejected:** Artificial rebalancing would distort real-world applicability

**4.3 Final Architecture Decision**
- **Chosen:** Pure MVP approach with neutral initialization
- **Rationale:** Maintains internal consistency - all features start from same knowledge baseline
- **Benefits:** Pedagogically sound, demonstrates convergence, reproducible

### Phase 5: Production-Ready Infrastructure (2024)

**5.1 Enterprise Architecture Implementation**

  - Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
  - Validation thresholds configurable without code changes

## Key Insights & Professional Discoveries

**Major Technical Discoveries:**
1. **Elo Continuity Bug:** Original implementation reset Elo ratings each season - this is incorrect in professional sports analytics
2. **Validation Importance:** Automated feature validation caught logical inconsistencies that manual inspection missed
3. **Baseline Reality Check:** Understanding that 43.6% (not 33.3%) is the real baseline to beat
4. **Feature Engineering Depth:** 12+ engineered features vs 3 raw features dramatically improves predictive power
5. **Consistency Principle:** If using limited historical data, maintain same limitation across all features
6. **Production vs Academic Gap:** Functional code ≠ Production-ready system. Infrastructure matters as much as algorithms
7. **Observability Critical:** Without logging and metrics tracking, debugging and optimization become impossible at scale
8. **Reproducibility Foundation:** Version everything - data, models, configurations. "It worked on my machine" is not acceptable

**Production vs MVP Trade-offs:**
- **MVP:** Start with equal Elo ratings, let system converge
- **Production:** Import previous season end ratings, maintain season-to-season continuity
- **MVP:** Constant K-factor for simplicity
- **Production:** Adaptive K-factor for market changes, transfers, etc.
- **MVP:** Print statements for debugging
- **Production:** Structured logging with persistent storage
- **MVP:** Manual testing and validation
- **Production:** Automated test suite with CI/CD integration
- **MVP:** Ad-hoc experiment tracking
- **Production:** Systematic metrics persistence and trend analysis

**Sports Analytics Best Practices:**
- Always validate features against known sporting contexts (Liverpool >> Norwich)
- Maintain temporal integrity across seasons
- Balance predictive power with interpretability
- Account for natural class imbalance in sports data
- Maintain internal consistency in feature initialization approaches

**MLOps & Production Best Practices:**
- **Reproducibility First:** Every experiment must be exactly reproducible
- **Fail Fast:** Automated testing catches issues before they reach production
- **Observability:** Log everything - data quality, model performance, system health
- **Configuration Management:** Parameterize everything that might change
- **Continuous Validation:** Monitor data drift, model degradation, performance trends
- **Documentation:** Self-documenting code + comprehensive project documentation

## v1 Results & Performance Analysis (August 2025)

### Critical Discovery: Training vs Validation Accuracy
**⚠️ Important Lesson Learned:** Initial results showed 76.9% accuracy, but this was **training accuracy** (model tested on data it was trained on). The true performance metric is **cross-validation accuracy**.

### v1.1 Performance (Final Validated Baseline) 🎯
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy: 51.2% ± 7.0%** ✅ **FINAL BASELINE**
- **Training Accuracy: 75.1%** ❌ **MISLEADING** (overfitting indicator)

**Critical Discovery - Feature Redundancy Fix:**
```
v1.0 (10 features): 50.0% ± 6.2% [included redundant points_diff + position_diff]
v1.1 (8 features):  51.2% ± 7.0% [removed redundant features] ← IMPROVED!
```

**v1.1 Fold-by-fold Results:**
```
Fold 1: 45.8% (train on early data, test on later data)
Fold 2: 53.9%
Fold 3: 48.2%
Fold 4: 54.2%
Fold 5: 53.7%
Mean: 51.2% ± 7.0%
```

### v1.1 Success Metrics ✅
- ✅ **Beats Random Baseline (33.3%)** → +17.9 points
- ✅ **Beats Majority Class Baseline (43.6%)** → +7.6 points
- ✅ **Achieves "Good Model" Target (>50%)** → +1.2 points  
- ❌ **Does not achieve "Excellent" Target (>55%)** → -3.8 points

### Key Technical Insights from v1.1
1. **Temporal Cross-Validation Works**: No data leakage, realistic performance estimation
2. **Feature Quality > Quantity**: 8 clean features outperform 10 with redundancy
3. **Multicollinearity Matters**: Removing correlated features improved performance (+1.2%)
4. **Class Balance Handling**: Balanced Random Forest handles natural class imbalance well
5. **Infrastructure Robust**: Full MLOps pipeline from data to evaluation functions correctly

### Top Performing Features (v1.1 - Clean Version)
1. **elo_diff_normalized**: 28.5% importance (+5.5% vs v1.0)
2. **shots_diff_normalized**: 18.5% importance (+4.1% vs v1.0)
3. **corners_diff_normalized**: 14.5% importance (+2.4% vs v1.0)
4. **form_diff_normalized**: 13.2% importance
5. **matchday_normalized**: 11.7% importance

### Critical Learning: Feature Redundancy Analysis
**Problem Identified**: `elo_diff`, `points_diff`, and `position_diff` all measure team strength, causing multicollinearity.

**Solution Applied**: Kept only `elo_diff_normalized` (most sophisticated and dynamic).

**Result**: Performance improved from 50.0% → 51.2% with fewer features.

**Lesson**: Always analyze feature correlations before ML training. Quality > quantity in feature engineering.

## v1.3 Experimental Validation (August 2025)

### v1.3 Experiments: Confirming v1.2 Optimality
After establishing v1.2 as a solid baseline, extensive experiments were conducted to test if further improvements were possible with current features and infrastructure.

### Experiment 1: Ensemble Methods Testing
**Objective**: Combine multiple optimized models to improve performance
**Methods Tested**:
- Voting Classifier (Hard & Soft)
- Stacking with Logistic Regression meta-learner
- Individual models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

**Results**:
- **Best Individual**: XGBoost Conservative (52.3%)
- **Best Ensemble**: Voting Hard (RF + XGB) (52.4%)
- **Improvement**: +0.2pp over v1.2 baseline

**Key Finding**: LightGBM (47.3%) significantly underperformed, dragging ensemble performance down.

### Experiment 2: Feature Interactions Analysis
**Objective**: Test if intelligent feature combinations could boost performance
**Interactions Created**:
1. `strength_form` = elo_diff × form_diff
2. `offensive_dominance` = shots_diff × corners_diff  
3. `elo_season_adjusted` = elo_diff × matchday_progress
4. `form_season_weighted` = form_diff × season_period
5. `h2h_form_blend` = weighted combination of H2H and form

**Results**:
- **8 Original Features**: 52.5% (Voting Hard)
- **8 + 2 Best Interactions**: 52.2% (-0.3pp)
- **8 + 5 All Interactions**: 51.3% (-1.2pp)

**Critical Discovery**: Feature interactions **degraded** performance consistently.

### v1.3 Experimental Conclusions
**Primary Finding**: v1.2 configuration (Random Forest, 8 features, 52.2%) was already **optimal** for current dataset.

**Evidence**:
1. **Ensemble Complexity vs Gain**: +0.3pp improvement insufficient to justify 2x complexity
2. **Feature Interaction Failure**: More features consistently hurt performance
3. **Algorithm Limits Reached**: Current feature set has hit natural ceiling

**Scientific Value**: Experiments validated that v1.2 represents the maximum extractable performance from current features and infrastructure.

### v1.3 Final Recommendation
**Status**: **No v1.3 Release** - experiments confirm v1.2 optimality
**Baseline Confirmed**: Random Forest (52.2% ± 2.8%) remains production configuration
**Next Phase**: Ready for v2 with external data sources (bookmaker odds, xG stats)

### Key Learnings from v1.3 Experiments
1. **Complexity vs Performance**: Simple often beats complex in ML
2. **Feature Interaction Risk**: More features ≠ better performance
3. **Ensemble Diminishing Returns**: Marginal gains at high complexity cost
4. **Dataset Ceiling Effect**: Current features have natural performance limit
5. **Scientific Rigor**: Systematic experimentation prevents overfitting to single approach
6. **Infrastructure Value**: Robust MLOps enables rapid, reliable experimentation
