This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the **Oddsy** repository.

## Project Overview

**Oddsy** is a Premier League football match prediction project that uses machine learning to predict Home/Draw/Away results. The project focuses on sophisticated feature engineering and data analysis of Premier League matches from 2019-2024.

## Project Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Build a machine learning model that predicts football match outcomes (H/D/A) better than naive baselines.

**Performance Targets:**
- **Minimum Acceptable:** > 43.6% accuracy (beat majority class baseline)
- **Good Model:** > 50% accuracy  
- **Excellent Model:** > 55% accuracy (industry-competitive)

**Key Baselines to Beat:**
- Random prediction (33/33/33): 33.3%
- Always predict Home: 43.6% 
- Weighted random by distribution: 35.4%

**Business Context:** Real Premier League distribution is naturally imbalanced (H: 43.6%, A: 33.4%, D: 23.0%) - this reflects actual football dynamics, not a data quality issue.

## Architecture & Data Pipeline

The project follows a clear data processing pipeline:

1. **Raw Data** (`data/raw/`) - Original Premier League CSV files
2. **Cleaned Data** (`data/cleaned/`) - Processed and cleaned datasets
3. **Processed Data** (`data/processed/`) - Feature-engineered datasets ready for ML
4. **Models** (`models/`) - Versioned trained models with metadata
5. **Evaluation** (`evaluation/`) - Performance reports & metrics history

## Development Evolution & Key Learnings

### **Phase 1: Initial Implementation (v1.0-v1.1)**

**v1.0 Discovery (50.0% accuracy):**
- Started with basic Elo ratings, form scores, H2H history
- **Critical Bug Found:** Elo ratings reset each season (incorrect!)
- Impact: Liverpool vs Norwich showed 0.500 (neutral) instead of Liverpool advantage

**v1.1 Feature Cleanup (51.2% accuracy):**
- **Key Learning:** Feature redundancy hurts performance
- Removed `points_diff` and `position_diff` (correlated with `elo_diff`)
- **Result:** 8 clean features outperformed 10 with redundancy (+1.2%)
- **Lesson:** Quality > quantity in feature engineering

### **Phase 2: Systematic Optimization (v1.2)**

**v1.2 "Camp de Base Avancé" (52.2% accuracy):**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV with 324 combinations (+1.0% gain)
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Random Forest vs XGBoost → RF more stable
- **Feature Engineering Experiments:** Adding features actually hurt performance
- **Key Insight:** Parsimony principle - simple often beats complex

### **Phase 3: Market Intelligence Integration (v1.3)**

**v1.3 Market Signal Discovery (53.05% accuracy):**
- **Odds Data Integration:** Complete Premier League odds 2019-2025 (6 seasons, 2280 matches)
- **Critical Investigation:** Direct market consensus features were redundant (0.9+ correlation with Elo)
- **Breakthrough:** `market_entropy_norm` (market uncertainty) provided unique signal
- **Systematic Debugging:** Full diagnostic pipeline prevented false abandonment
- **Feature Selection:** Top-7 subset outperformed all complex ensemble approaches

## Critical Technical Discoveries

### **🔬 Major Breakthroughs:**

1. **Elo Continuity Bug:** Ratings must carry over between seasons (industry standard)
2. **Feature Correlation Analysis:** 0.9+ correlations require removal for optimal performance  
3. **Market Intelligence Value:** Betting market uncertainty adds predictive power beyond traditional metrics
4. **Feature Selection Superiority:** Statistical selection beats ensemble complexity
5. **Data Leakage Prevention:** All features must use only historical data
6. **Automated Validation:** Testing catches logical inconsistencies manual inspection misses

### **🏗️ Infrastructure Lessons:**

**Production vs Academic Gap:** Functional code ≠ Production-ready system
- **Before:** Print statements, hardcoded parameters, manual testing
- **After:** Structured logging, configuration-driven, automated testing

**MLOps Implementation:**
- **Versioning:** MD5 hashing for data integrity and model reproducibility
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite prevents regressions
- **Logging:** Professional logging with persistent storage
- **Metrics:** Historical performance tracking and trend analysis

## Essential Commands

python scripts/preprocessing/feature_engineering.py     # Original (has Elo bug)
python scripts/preprocessing/fix_leakage_features.py    # Enhanced + leakage fixes

# Analysis & Validation
python scripts/analysis_root_migration/validate_features.py
python scripts/analysis_root_migration/calculate_baselines.py
```

## Data Integrity & Best Practices

### **Critical Data Principles:**
- **No Data Leakage:** All features calculated using ONLY historical data
- **Temporal Integrity:** Proper time-series cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit)
- **Feature Normalization:** All ML features normalized to 0-1 range
- **Target Encoding:** H→0, D→1, A→2

### **Elo Rating System:**
- **MVP Approach:** Initialize all teams equally, let system converge
- **K-Factor:** Constant K=32 for simplicity and reproducibility
- **Season Continuity:** Ratings carry over between seasons (critical!)

### **Feature Engineering Principles:**
1. **Quality over Quantity:** 7 optimized features > 10+ redundant features
2. **Correlation Control:** Remove features with >0.9 correlation
3. **Market Intelligence:** Odds microstructure more valuable than consensus
4. **Temporal Windows:** Use proper rolling statistics (5-match form, etc.)
